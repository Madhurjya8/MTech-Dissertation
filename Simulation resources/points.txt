1 DAG rank is calculated from udp-client.c file and ETX , step value and rank inc value is calculated from rpl_mrhof.c file

/home/user/Desktop/Objective_Function/COMPOSITE_RPL/contiki/core/net/rpl/rpl-icmp6.c
2 BDI calculation is done by rpl-icmp6.c file


3 energy consumption is defined in tcpip.c file
4 data aggregation method is defined in uip6.c file

/home/user/Desktop/Objective_Function/COMPOSITE_RPL/contiki/core/net/rpl
5 rpl initial enegy value is filed in rplconfig.h file


6 data sent time and receive time is defined in udp-client.c file and udp-server.c file respectively
7 rpl minhoprank val is maintained in rpl-private.h file
